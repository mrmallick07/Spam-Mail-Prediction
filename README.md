# 📧 Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning

A Natural Language Processing project that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam**.  
This project demonstrates text preprocessing, vectorization using TF-IDF, and model building using Naive Bayes.

---

## 📘 Overview
With the massive increase in emails, identifying spam messages automatically is crucial.  
This project uses the **SMS Spam Collection dataset** and applies **TF-IDF Vectorization** with a **Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier** to detect spam efficiently.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)  
- **Samples:** 5,574 messages  
- **Features:** Message text  
- **Target:** Spam / Ham (Not Spam)

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK  
- TF-IDF Vectorizer  

---

## 🚀 Model
- **Algorithm:** Multinomial Naive Bayes  
- **Accuracy:** ~96% on test set  
- **Evaluation:** Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

---

## 📈 Results
The model achieves high accuracy and performs exceptionally well for spam classification tasks using lightweight ML methods.

---

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Experiment with SVM, Logistic Regression, or ensemble models  
- Explore Deep Learning models (LSTM, BERT) for better performance  
- Deploy the model as a web app using Streamlit
